DS Structs but Garbage Collected (for GMS/GML 2.3+)

This repository contains WIP (Work in progress) version of GameMaker Studio 2.3+ ds_xxx structures, which can be garbage collected.

General naming convention is to use just common ds_xxx name for each structure (ds_map, ds_list, ds_whatever) for each type.

As for now, only example of ds_map() is made.
